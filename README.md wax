### [Visit Documentation](https://developer.wax.io/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 18 or higher.
- Terminal for accessing VitePress via its command line interface (CLI).
- Text Editor with Markdown syntax support.
- VSCode is recommended, along with the official Vue extension.

VitePress can be used on its own, or be installed into an existing project. In both cases, you can install it with:

```sh
npm install
```

## Up and Running

The tool should have also injected the following npm scripts to your package.json if you allowed it to do so during the setup process:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vitepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vitepress build docs",
    "docs:preview": "vitepress preview docs"
  },
  ...
}
````

```sh
npm run docs:dev
```
